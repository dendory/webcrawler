# Web Crawler Application

This is a modern self-hosted web crawler application that creates WARC archives from web sites with a WARC viewer.

## Features

- **Simple and Advanced crawling modes**: Basic HTTP requests or Chromium-based crawling
- **WARC archive creation**: Creates standard WARC files for web archiving
- **Bootstrap web interface**: Modern web UI for managing crawls and viewing archives
- **Internet Archive integration**: Upload archives directly to Internet Archive
- **Pattern-based URL filtering**: Ignore unwanted URLs during crawling
- **Retry logic**: Retry mechanism for handling temporary failures
- **Automatic detection of additional archives**: Every 5 minutes, newly added or deleted archives are detected

## Installation

### Docker Installation

```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name webcrawler \
     --restart always \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     -v /path/to/your/data/archives:/data/archives \
     -v /path/to/your/data/db:/data/db \
     -v /path/to/your/data/temp:/data/temp \
     -v /path/to/your/data/config:/data/config \
     dendory02/webcrawler:latest
```

The web interface will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Manual Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Linux host (Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/RHEL, or Fedora)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip3

#### Installation

1. **Download the zipped repo to your Linux host**
2. **Run the installation script as root:**

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installation script will:
- Create the directory structure at `/opt/crawler/`
- Install Python dependencies in a virtual environment
- Set up the systemd service
- Configure crontab for the runner script
- Start the web crawler service

## Directory Structure

After installation, the application uses the following directory structure:

```
/opt/crawler/
├── app/                    # Application files
│   ├── crawler.py          # Main web crawler application
│   ├── runner.py           # Manual archive runner script
│   └── templates/          # Web interface templates
├── config/                 # Configuration files
│   ├── crawler.cfg         # Main configuration
│   └── default_ignores.tsv # Default URL ignore patterns
├── archives/               # WARC archive files
├── db/                     # SQLite database
├── temp/                   # Temporary crawl files
└── venv/                   # Python virtual environment
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `/opt/crawler/config/crawler.cfg`.

Key settings include:

- **Web Interface**: IP address and port (default: 0.0.0.0:8080)
- **SSL Settings**: Certificate and key paths for HTTPS
- **Connection Settings**: Timeout, retry limits, and delays
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum sizes for displaying binary files
- **Crawling Settings**: User agents, accept headers, and language preferences

### Password Authentication

The web crawler includes a simple password-based authentication system to protect access to the web interface. The default password is **`archive`**.

To change the password, you need to generate a SHA256 hash of your new password and update the configuration file. For example:

```bash
 echo -n "your_new_password" | sha256sum
```

## Usage

Access the web interface at `http://your-server:8080` (or your configured IP/port).

Features:
- Start new crawls with custom settings
- View crawl progress in real-time
- Browse and download WARC archives
- Upload archives to Internet Archive
- Manage URL ignore patterns
